## What is Payload-CMS ?

Payload is a headless CMS and application framework. It's meant to provide a massive boost to the development process, but importantly, stay out of the way as our apps get more complex.
Out of the box, Payload gives you a lot of the things that you often need when developing a new website, web app, or native app:

+ A database to store our data (Postgres and MongoDB supported)
+ A way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data of any shape via full REST and GraphQL APIs
+ Authenticationâ€”complete with commonly required functionality like registration, email verification, login, & password reset
+ Deep access control to our data, based on document or field-level functions
+ File storage and access control
+ A beautiful admin UI that's generated specifically to suit our data

By integrating Payload.CMS into our E-Commerce Website project, we aim to deliver a cutting-edge web application that not only meets but exceeds user expectations while providing a seamless content management experience for our team.

## Thank You.
